This is the box that holds the breadboard and the arduino. It takes some work to get both in there, but once you put them in there, it'll snap in properly. 
There is also a button holder which will allow the buttons to snap into it. Then, the holder will slot into holes in balsa.
The balsa wood prevents the need to 3D print everything while the holder allows us to still have a very clean snap into the holder.
