This is the ramp that holds the marbles. Contains space for a small 9g servo. I just hot glued the turning mechanism into place on the servo horn.

One is the full sized one, which is 280mm long.
The stl has been broken into two parts which you can glue together. (184 and 161mm wide)
For the f3z you can simply hide bodies until you get a width that works for you.

It is an f3z because it contains an extra component (the servo) (link below)
