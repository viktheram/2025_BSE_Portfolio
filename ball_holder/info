This is the ramp that holds the marbles. Contains space for a small 9g servo. I just hot glued the turning mechanism into place on the servo horn.

One is the full sized one, which is 280mm long.
The stl has only 5 ramps. Print three of them and you can glue them together (168mm wide)
For the f3z you can simply hide bodies until you get a width that works for you.

It is an f3z because it contains an extra component (the servo) (link below)
