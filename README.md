This is where you can view all of my 3D printed files. I will include all my prototypes and iterations right here. These were made on autodesk fusion.
I will include both a .stl and a .f3d file. .stl is accepted on most 3D printers and will allow you to print my file directly. 
The .f3d will allow you to open up the file on fusion, see the timeline, view my sketches, and very easily make edits (as long as you have autodesk fusion installed)
