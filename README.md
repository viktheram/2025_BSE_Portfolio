Here you will find all my iterations! There will be many packets where the sole purpose of the code is to test the display functionality while some packets will be the entire code. The code is intended to work on Arduino IDE. The code is copied from there into the github.

You can also go into the branches above to see other aspects - such as the styling behind the final page presentation and also my CAD files!
